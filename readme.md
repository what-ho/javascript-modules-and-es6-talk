## Angular modules 
(angular v1) 

* 'angular' available in global webpage context (i.e. window.angular)  
* scripts can register modules with angular, request modules (dependency injection)
* scripts manually included with html <script src=..></script> tags, angular not connected with loading scripts
* works well with all-angular apps
